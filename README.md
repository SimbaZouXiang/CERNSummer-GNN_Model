# CERNSummer-GNN_Model

This folder contains two models using GNN methods. The normal GNN method consisting 3 GCN and 3 SAGEConv layers, this is also the model I used to present the data in the Report.
The second file is the GIN file, which is the Graph Isomorphism Network, as presented by some paper, it has good properties, but it is not the case for me.
